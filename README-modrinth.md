# Etherology

**Etherology** is a fabulous mod that plays on immersion and disclosure of its *global lore*. This project is bound to give you an unforgettable feeling of exploring a new world with detailed *mechanics* and eye-pleasing *vanilla* design.

Immerse yourself in the study of ancient knowledge and try to curb all the mysteries of the **Ether**! Discover new technologies, alchemical crafting recipes, create your own staff and distort reality as you please! If you wish, visit the ***Golden Forest*** - a fabulous forest of yellow-leaved trees, or dive into the bowels of the earth in search of a source of *unimaginable power*!

Etherology is not strict on attention, play for fun, and the mod will only *sweeten* your stay in the game. But if you are ready to discover this world in a new way - *go for the truth*!

## Special thanks
It's no secret that this mod was inspired by another similar project - *Thaumcraft*. We respect Azanor's work for his wonderful work, and we aim to *rethink* many successful ideas of that time so that even years later you can return to that vast world.

## Note
This project is under development and a lot of things can be changed. Considering that the mod already has a lot of content, it's not even half ready for release, so... we hope that *Etherology* will not leave you indifferent, write a review and share it with your friends!
